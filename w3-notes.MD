# THESE ARE MY NOTES FROM WEEK THREE OF LHL'S WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP.




METHOD TELLS A FORM WHAT METHOD TO USE.
NAME GIVES A FORM INPUT A NAME TO BE USED AS A USERS SUBMISSION KEY.

BROWSER ENGINES HAVE A HEAP AND A CALL STACK.
BLOCKING SLOWS DOWN BROWSERS BECUASE THAY HAVE TO MULTITASK AND SEND MULTIPLE API REQUESTS TO LOAD DATA AT THE SAME TIME.
THE SOLUTION IS ASYNC.

ALTHOUGH JS IS SINGLE THREADED IT CLEARS ITS TASKS SYNCONOUSLY AND SENDS ASYNC FUNCTIONS TO THE TASKS QUEUE.
THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS CALLED AN EVENT LOOP.
DON'T BLOCK THE EVENT LOOP.

PROMISE OBJECTS ARE USED FOR ASYNC CODE.
PROMISES CAN HAVE 4 STATES FULLFILLED/RESOLVED REJECTED PENDING AND SETTLED.
A PROMISE CAN ONLY BE SETTLED ONCE! IF THE PROCESS IN THE PROMISE TAKES A LONG TIME IT CAN CAUSE BLOCKING 
A .THEN STATEMENT DOESN'T RESOLVE & REJECT ARGUEMENTS FOR THE SAME PROMISE.
IF THE .THEN OF A PROMISE IS CALLED AND DOESN'T RESOLVE IT SHIPS THE RESPONSE TO THE REJECT FUNCTION IN THE CHAIN

iF WORKING WITH PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES WORK DIRECTLY WITH THIER VALUE.


.CREATESERVER IS AN HTTP METHOD THAT CREATES SERVERS.
.LISTEN IS A CALLBACK THAT TAKES TIME TO EXECUTE THIS IS ASYNC!
WHEN WE CREATE A .REQUEST HANDLER WE CAN SET UP IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS TO HANDLE DIFFERENT RESPONSES

ROUTING: THE METHOD USED BY ENDPOINTS TP RESPOND TO CLIENT REQUESTS,
IF WE HAD TO WRITE HTML USING THE SEND METHOD IT WOULD TAKE TOO LOOOOOOOOONG.... THIS IS WHY WE USE TEMPLATES.
TEMPLATES ARE EASIER TO DEBUG.... AND THEY KEEP HTML AS PARTS IN DIFFERENT FILES MAKING OUR HTML NICE AND SHORT.
TEMPLATES DEFINE THE PRESENTATION OF A WEB APP'S DATA SPERATELY FROM SERVER LOGIC
TEMPLATE ENGINES LET YUS REPLACE VARIABLES IN A TEMPLATE WITH ACTUAL DATA,
WE SET TEJS AS THE VIUEW ENGINE USING THE EXPRESS .SET METHOD.
EJS PARTIALS ARE CODE THAT WILL BE REUSED OFTEN ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SITE.
TO USE AN EJS PARTIAL WE 'INCLUDE FILENMAE BETWEEN <% %> TAGS.
TO USE A SINGLE VARIABLE WE CAN WRITE THE FILENAME BETWEEN <% %>
WE CAN WIRTE MULTIPLE LINES OF JAVASCRIPT CODE USING ALLIGATOR TAGS <% %>
WHEN WE SEND VARIABLES TO EJS TEMPLATEVARS WE NEED TO SEND IT AN OBJECT SO WE CAN ACCESS IT USING KEYS.
REQ.PARAMS ASCESSES INFO FROM THE URL.
ALLIGATOR TAGS WORK LIKE TEMPLATE LITERALS AS IN THE LET YOU REFERENCE DATA THAT IS SOMEWHERE ELSE USING THE PROPER SYNTAX.

CURL IS A COMMAND LINE UTILITY THAT IS USED TO MAKE HTTP REQUEST TO URLS.

APPLICATIONS ARE JUST FANCY USER INTERFACES ON TOP OF DATABASES.
WHEN WE SEND A SAFE REQ TO READ SOME INFO WE USE GET.
WHEN WE WANT TO UPDATE A RESOURCE WE SHOULD USE POST!
ACTION TELLS A FORM WHAT PATH  TO SUBMIT TO.


SERVERS CAN TELL CLIENTS TO HOLD KEYS AS IDENTIFIERS. THESE KEYS ARE CALLED COOKIES
COOKIES PASS ALONG INFO TO SERVERS WHO USE IT AS A KEY TO STORE INFO.
ONE COOKIOE CAN'T BE READ BY MULTIPLE WEB PAGES
PARTS OF WEB PAGES CAN BE USED TO READ COOKIES OF OTHERS. THIS TYPE OF PRESENCE IS USED TO ADVERTISE. 
DATA IS SENT AS A BUFFER WHILE ITS GREAT AT IT WE NEED BODY-PARSER TO BE ABLE TO READ IT
SSL CERTIFICATES CREATE A SECURE WAY TO PROTECT USERS FROM THE VULNERABILITIES OF A MIDDLE-MAN ATTACK.

A REPO DIAGRAM CAN HELP YUOU MAP OUT GIT BRANCHES
EACH BRANCH OF A REPO CORRESPONDS TO A FEATURE, EACH USER CORRESPONDS TO A BRANCH.


HTTP IS STATELESS REQUESTS ARE EACH HANDLED INDIVIDUALLY
REST IS A SET OF RULES FOLLOWED WHEN ACCESSING OR MANIPULATING DATA OVER HTTP.
WE ACCESS DATA RESOURCES THRU URLS
REST APIs ENDPOINTS REFLECT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OBJECTS IN A RESOURCE.  
HTTP METHODS MAP WELL WITH REST USING BREAD WHICH IS LIKE CRUD EXCEPT IT SPLITS READ INTO TO TWO
BROWSE COLLECTION READ MEMBER EDIT MEMBER ADD TO COLLECTION DELETE MEMBER
WHEN WE FIND A RESOURCE WE CAN USE WE HAVE TO DECLARE IT AS A VARIABLE AND GIVE IT AN IDENTIFIER.
THE IDENTIFIER SHOULD BE THE NAME OF THE OBJECT'S TYPE PLURAL.
THE WAY THAT THE RESPONSE IS REPRESENTED IS ESTABLSHED IN THE ACCEPT HEADER.
WE TAKE THE DATA THAT IS SENT BACK AND REPRESENT IT IN HTML ON FRONT END.

THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF AN APP IS IT'S DATA!!
PRORAMMING REVOLVES AROUND DATA, WE WRITE CODE SO WE CAN READ, EDIT AND DELETE DATA.
THE WAY WE STORE AND STRUCTURE DATA INFLUENCES HOW EFFIECIENT WE ARE AT USING IT.
ARRAYS AND OBJECTS ARE MEANT TO HELP ORGANIZE OUR DATA EFFIECIENTLY.
ANOTHER TYPE OF DATA STRUCTURE IS A TREE.
TREES LEVERAGE RELATIONSHIPS TO ORGANIZE DATA.
NODES ARE ELEMENTS OF TREES THAT REPRESENT AN ENTITY AND IT'S DATA.
NODES ARE CONNECTED USING EDGES
THE NODE AT THE TOP IS CALLED THE ROOT.

EVERY NODE THAT ISN'T THE ROOT HAS A SINGLE PARENT NODE,
EVERY NODE AT THE BOTTOM OF A TREE IS CONSIDERED A LEAF,
EVERY NODE THAT ISN'T A LEAF IS A CHILD.
ALL NODES WITH THE SAME PARENT NODE ARE SIBLINGS.
NODES ARE REPRESENTED IN THE DOM: THERE ARE PARENT ELEMENTS, AND IT'S DEPENDANT ELEMENTS ARE IT'S CHILDREN.
TREES ARE HELPFUL WHEN OUR DATA HAS A HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE.

TRAVERSING A TREE IS SIMILAIR TO LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY.
BREADTH FIRST SEARCH ----> WHEN SEARCHING FOR A NODE WE TRAVERSE EVERY NODE STARTING AT THE ROOT UNTIL WE FIND IT.
DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL ----> STARTS AT THE ROOT AND FOLLOWS ALL OF IT'S CHILD'S PATH'S DOWN TO THE LEAVES BEFORE MOVING ON TO ITS SIBLING.

USING A ':' IN THE URL LETS US ACCESS THE KEY IN THE REQ PARAMS OBJECT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO USE IN OUR ROUTES.
