# THESE ARE MY NOTES FROM WEEK FOUR OF LHL'S WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP.


FLOATS ALLOW ELEMENTS TO APPEAR NEXT TO AND APART FROM ONE ANOTHER;
WHEN AN ELEMENT IS FLOATED IT'S DEPENDANT ON THW ELEMENTS AROUND IT.
THE MOST POPULAR PROBLEM WITH FLOATS IS WHEN THE PARENT ELEMENT HAD TOO MANY FLOATED ELEMENTS.
WHEN THIS HAPPENS IT COLLAPSES THE HEIGHT TO 0.
THE OVERFLOW TECHNIQUE -----> SETTING A PARENT ELEMENTS OVERFLOW TO AUTO WILL CONTAIN ALL THE ELEMENTS.
IT WILL ALSO ADD A SCORLL BAR ., IF YOU DON'T WANT IT THERE USE OVERFLOW HIDDEN.
OVERFLOW IS READ DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT BROSERS CREATING DISPLAY PROBLEMS.

THE CLEARFIX TECHNIQUE USES THE :BEFORE AND :AFTER PSUEDO ELEMENTS ON THE PARENT ELEMENT.
WE CREATE ELEMENTS ABOVE AND BELOW THE PARENT ELEMENTS BY CREATING ANONYMOUS TABLES,
WE GET RID OF IT BY UUDING THE AFTER PSEUDO TO CLEAR THE TABLES.
CREATING A .GROUP CLASS AND STYLING IT LIKE THIS AND APPLYING IT TO THE PARENT ELEMENTS MAKES IT EASY.

POSITION PROPERTY ACCEPTS FIVE VALUES WHICH PROVIDE WAYS TO POSITION AN ELEMENT.
DEFUALT POSITION IS STATIC.
RELATIVE FIXED AND ABSOLUTE HAVE BOX OFFSET PROPERTIES RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT.
THE OFFSET PROPERTIES WILL MOVE AN OBJECT BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNITS RELATIVE TO OUR STARTING POSITION.
THE OFFSET PROPERTIES WILL MOVE AN OBJECT RELATIVCE TO ITS PARENT WHEN USING FIXED OR ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS.
ABSOLUTE POSITIONS TIED TO THE PARENT ELEMENT IF NO PARENT IS PRESENT IT WILL BE POSITIONED IN RELATION TO THE BODY.
FIXED POSITION IS ALSO RELATIVE TO IT'S PARENT. NUT LIMITS THE ELEMENTS TO ITS VIEWPORT.
Z INDEX LETS YOU STACK ITREMS IN THE ORDER UOI ASSIGN THIS PROPERTY.

THERE ARE MANY DOM EVENTS THAT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE ON A PAGE.
IN JS WE LISTEN TO EVENTS USING A STRING THAT SPECIFIES AN EVENT NAME AND A CALLBACCK THAT GETS CALLED ON THE RESPONSE.
USE CAPTURE DECLARES IF A BOOLEAN SHOULD BE FIRED IN THE CAPTURE PHASE.
USING THE BIND KEYWORD ON THE METHOD OF AN ELEMENT WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNCTION IS ALWAYS REFFERRING TO THIS.
EVENT OBJECTS ARE CREATED AFTER THE FIRST EVENT HAPPENS.
EVENT OBJECTS ARE LOADED WITH INFORMATION.
WHEN THE EVENT FLOWS FROM THE DOM TO THE BROWSER THIS IS CALLLED THE CAPTURE PHASE.
THE CAPTURE PHASE BUILDS THE APTH THAT THE EVENT WILL TRAVEL BACK ON DURING THE BUBBLING.

WHEN THE EVENT REACHES THE USER IT'S CALLED THE TARGET PHASE.
EVENTS FIRE ON TARGET NODES.
THE EVENT TARGET IS THE MOST DEEPLY LISTED ELEMENT WHERE THE EVENT IS HAPPENING.
EVENTS COME BACK TO THE PARENT NODE DURING THE BUBBLING PHASE.
ALL THESE PATTERNS HAVE A LAYOUT 3 DIV'S WITHIN A DIV STARTING WITH SMALLEST VIEW AND ADDING BREAKPOINT'S TO IT.
